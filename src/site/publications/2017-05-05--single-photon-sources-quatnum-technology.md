## Abstract

In this presentation, the results of the joint research project [“Single-Photon Sources for Quantum Technologies” (SIQUTE)](https://www.euramet.org/research-innovation/search-research-projects/details/project/single-photon-sources-for-quantum-technologies) will be presented.

The focus will be on the development of absolutely characterized single-photon sources, on the realization of an efficient waveguide-based single-photon source at the telecom wavelengths of 1.3 µm and 1.55 µm, on the implementation of the quantum-enhanced resolution in confocal fluorescence microscopy and on the development of a detector for very low photon fluxes
