## Abstract


The silicon-vacancy (SiV) color center in diamond is a solid-state single photon emitter and spin
quantum bit suited as a component in quantum devices. Here, we show that SiV centers in
nanodiamonds exhibit a strongly inhomogeneous distribution with regard to the center wavelengths
and linewidths of the zero-phonon-line (ZPL) emission at room temperature.

We find that the SiV centers separate in two clusters: one group exhibits ZPLs with center wavelengths within a narrow
range ≈730–742 nm and broad linewidths between 5 and 17 nm, whereas the second group comprises
a very broad distribution of center wavelengths between 715 and 835 nm, but narrow linewidths from
below 1 up to 4 nm.

Supported by ab initio Kohn–Sham density functional theory calculations we
show that the ZPL shifts of the first group are consistently explained by strain in the diamond lattice.
Further, we suggest, that the second group showing the strongly inhomogeneous distribution of center
wavelengths might be comprised of a new class of silicon-related defects. Whereas single photon
emission is demonstrated for defect centers of both clusters, we show that emitters from different
clusters show different spectroscopic features such as variations of the phonon sideband spectra and
different blinking dynamics.
