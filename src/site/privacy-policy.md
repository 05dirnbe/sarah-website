This privacy policy sets out how I use and protect any information that you provide when you use this website.

I'm committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected. If you're asked to provide information by which you can be identified when using this website, then you can be assured that it will only be used the way I will describe in this privacy statement.

The policy may change from time to time, and I'll do that by updating this page. Check back from time to time to make sure you're happy with any changes. This policy is effective from 18/10/19.


## What's collected

No information is collected without your knowing. There are no tracking cookies on this website, so the only information I will receive is what you explicitly [send me](/contact); things like:

- Your name
- Contact information, including email address

## What's done with your information

Quite reasonably, if you'd like me to work with you, I'll need to know all about your project, but details of it will go no further without your express permission.

If we end up collaborating, I'll use your information to keep in touch, and sometimes you might get:

- The odd email about new ideas I have
- Information that I think you'll find interesting

## Security

I'm committed to ensuring that your information is secure. Among other things, I use [two factor authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication) on every service I use and all passwords are unique and [stored in a password manager](https://1password.com/).


## Cookies

A cookie is a small file which is placed on your computer's hard drive. I think these are intrusive, unnecessary and provide information that I would never use, so I don't use cookies.

I do glean *some* totally anonymous information from visitors via [server logs](https://www.netlify.com/gdpr-ccpa), which allow me to see very broad numbers on which pages get the most visitors. All information is discarded within 30 days.

Not using cookies also means I don't have to annoy you with those awful pop up banners!

## Links to other websites

This website contains links to other websites. I try to link to reputable sources, but be sure to check out their privacy statements as I can't accept any responsibility for your privacy once you've left this site.

## Questions

If you have any questions about this privacy policy or your personal data, [feel free to ask](/contact).
