This privacy policy sets out how I use and protect any information that you provide when you use this website.

I'm committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected. If you're asked to provide information by which you can be identified when using this website, then you can be assured that it will only be used the way I will describe in this privacy statement.

## What's collected

No information is collected without your knowing. There are no tracking cookies on this website, so the only information I will receive is what you explicitly [send me](/contact); things like:

- Your name
- Contact information, including email address

## What's done with your information

Quite reasonably, if you'd like me to work with you, I'll need to know about you and your work, but details of it will go no further without your express permission.

## Security

I'm committed to ensuring that your information is secure. Among other things, I use [two factor authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication) on every service I use and all passwords are strong, unique and [stored in a password manager](https://1password.com/).

## Cookies

A cookie is a small file which is placed on your computer's hard drive. I think these are intrusive, unnecessary and provide information that I would never use, so I don't use cookies.

I do glean *some* totally anonymous information from visitors via [server logs](https://www.netlify.com/gdpr-ccpa), which allow me to see very broad numbers on which pages get the most visitors. All information is discarded within 30 days.

Not using cookies also means I don't have to annoy you with those awful pop up banners!

## Links to other websites

This website contains links to other websites. I try to link to reputable sources, but be sure to check out their privacy statements as I can't accept any responsibility for your privacy once you've left this site.

## Content from other websites

This website embeds content from [Uni Graz Online]({{site.author.courses}}) to directly show the courses I am teaching momentarily and give prospective attendees the option to sign-up on the spot.

When you interact whith the embedded content, keep in mind that the universities [privacy statement](https://www.uni-graz.at/de/datenschutzerklaerung/) applies.

## Questions

If you have any questions about this privacy policy or your personal data, [feel free to ask](/contact).
