I'd love to meet you in person. If you are in Graz, find me in my [office]({{site.adress.room.url}}) or my [lab]({{site.adress.lab.url}}) on regular workdays. Check out my university [contact card]({{site.author.card}}).

Otherwise, email me at [sarah.lindner@uni-graz.at](mailto:{{ site.author.email }}). I'll get back to you as soon as I can.
