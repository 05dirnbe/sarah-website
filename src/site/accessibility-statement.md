I am not an expert in webdesign, however, I try my best to:

- meet the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) version 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22) at levels A, AA and AAA.
- meet the success criteria (A, AA, and AAA) in the older [WCAG version 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) standard.

While I'm not aware of any current issues with this website, there's a chance that something has been missed or broken.

If you have any trouble accessing any part of this website please [email me](/contact) and I'll fix it as a matter of priority.
